The libStorage project welcomes, and depends, on contributions from developers
and users in the open source community. Contributions can be made in a number of
ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

## Reporting an Issue

Please include as much detail as you can. This includes:

  * The OS type and version
  * The libStorage commit
  * The storage system in question
  * A set of logs with debug-logging enabled that show the problem

## Submitting Pull Requests

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
most likely need to have tests and documentation if it is a new feature.
